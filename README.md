# 📰 Real-Time News Sentiment Analysis Pipeline using AWS

An end-to-end, event-driven news ingestion, sentiment analysis, storage, and visualization pipeline built with AWS, Python, Docker, PostgreSQL, and Streamlit.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end real-time news sentiment analysis pipeline designed to demonstrate how modern cloud and data engineering technologies can be combined to build an automated data workflow.

The system periodically collects the latest technology-related news from the GNews API, stores the original API response in Amazon S3, processes the articles using Python, performs sentiment analysis using VADER, and stores the structured results in PostgreSQL hosted on Amazon RDS.

A Streamlit dashboard reads the processed data from PostgreSQL and presents sentiment statistics and news information through a web interface. The dashboard is containerized with Docker and deployed on Amazon ECS using AWS Fargate. Docker images are stored in Amazon ECR.

The entire ingestion workflow is automated using Amazon EventBridge Scheduler, which invokes the Lambda function every five minutes.

This project showcases:

- Event-driven architecture
- Serverless data processing
- REST API integration
- Sentiment analysis
- Cloud storage
- Relational database integration
- Docker containerization
- AWS container deployment
- Data visualization
- IAM and cloud monitoring

EventBridge
    ↓
AWS Lambda

This removes the need to manually execute the ingestion process.

---

## Step 2 — Fetch News Data

The Lambda function connects to the GNews API and requests recent technology news.

The API returns a JSON response containing article information such as:

- Title
- Description
- Content
- URL
- Image
- Publication date
- Source information

Example flow:
```
GNews API
    ↓
JSON Response
    ↓
AWS Lambda
```
---

## Step 3 — Store Raw Data in S3

Before transforming the data, the original GNews API response is stored in Amazon S3.

Example structure:
```
news-sentiment-raw/
└── raw-news/
    └── 2026/
        └── 09/
            └── 08/
                └── 143000.json
```
Keeping the raw response provides a source copy that can be used for debugging, auditing, or future reprocessing.

---

## Step 4 — Process News Articles

Lambda extracts the articles from the API response.

The processing layer:

- Extracts article fields
- Combines title, description, and content
- Normalizes source information
- Prepares text for sentiment analysis
- Creates structured article records

The raw API data is transformed into a consistent format before database insertion.

---

## Step 5 — Sentiment Analysis

The processed article text is passed to VADER Sentiment Analysis.

VADER calculates a compound sentiment score.

The project classifies the result using:

Compound Score >= 0.05
        ↓
     Positive

Compound Score <= -0.05
        ↓
     Negative

Between -0.05 and 0.05
        ↓
     Neutral

Each article receives:

- Sentiment Label
- Sentiment Score

Example:
```
{
    "label": "positive",
    "score": 0.91
}
```
---

## Step 6 — Store Processed Data in PostgreSQL

The processed articles are inserted into PostgreSQL hosted on Amazon RDS.

The database stores structured information including:

- Article ID
- Title
- Description
- Content
- URL
- Image
- Publication timestamp
- Language
- Source
- Sentiment
- Sentiment score

Duplicate articles are prevented using the article ID.
```
Article
   ↓
Check Article ID
   ↓
Already Exists?
   ├── Yes → Skip
   └── No  → Insert
```
---

## Step 7 — Streamlit Dashboard

The Streamlit application connects to PostgreSQL and reads the processed data.

The dashboard provides a visual representation of the collected news and sentiment information.

Typical metrics include:

- Total Articles
- Positive Articles
- Neutral Articles
- Negative Articles

It can also display individual articles and their sentiment scores.

---

## Step 8 — Docker Containerization

The application workloads are packaged using Docker.

The project contains container configurations for:

- AWS Lambda
- Streamlit Dashboard

Containerization provides a reproducible environment containing the application and its dependencies.

---

## Step 9 — Amazon ECR

The Docker images are pushed to private Amazon ECR repositories.

Repositories:

news-sentiment-lambda
news-sentiment-dashboard

Deployment flow:

Docker Build
     ↓
Amazon ECR
     ↓
AWS Service

---

## Step 10 — ECS Fargate Deployment

The Streamlit dashboard runs as an ECS service using AWS Fargate.

Current configuration:

Cluster:
news-sentiment-cluster

Service:
news-sentiment-dashboard-service

Container Port:
8501

Fargate provides managed container compute without requiring the project to manage EC2 servers.
